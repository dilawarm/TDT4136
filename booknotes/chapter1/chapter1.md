# 1 - Introduction
_In which we try to explain why we consider artificial intelligence to be a subject most worthy of study, and in which we try to decide what exactly it is, this being a good thing to decide before embarking_

This chapter defines AI and establishes the cultural background against which it has developed. Some of the important points are as follows:
* Different people approach AI with different goals in mind. Two important questions to ask are: Are you concerned with thinking or behaviour? Do you want to model humans or work from an ideal standard?
* In this book, we adopt the view that intelligence is concerned mainly with __rational action__. Ideally, an __intelligent agent__ takes the best possible action in a situation. We study the problem of builing agents that are intelligent in this sense.
* Philosophers (going back to 400 B.C.) made AI conceivable by considering the ideas that the mind is some ways like a machine, that it operates on knowledge encoded in some internal language, and that thought can be used to choose what actions to take.
* Mathematicians provided the tools to manipulate statemens of logical certainly as well as uncertain, probabilistic statements. They also set the groundwork for understanding computation and reasoning about algorithms.
* Economists formalized the problem of making decisions that maximize the expected outcome to the decision maker.
* Neuroscientists discovered some facts about how the brain works and the ways in which it is similar to and different from computers.
* Psychologists adopted the idea that humans and animals can be considered information-processing machines. Linguists showed that language use fits into this model.
* Computer engineers provided the ever-more-powerful machines that make AI applications possible.
* Control theory deals with designing devices that act optimally on the basis of feedback from environment. Initially, the mathematical tools of control theory were quite different from AI, but the fields are coming closer together.
* The history of AI has had cycles of success, misplaced optimism, and resulting cutbacks in enthusisasm and funding. There have also been cycles of introducing new creative approaches and systematically refining the best ones.
* AI has advanced more rapidly in the past decade because of greater use of the scientific method in experimenting with and comparing approaches.
* Recent progress in understanding the theoretical basis for intelligence has gone hand in hand with improvements in the capabilities of real systems. The subfields of AI have become more integrated, and AI has found common ground with other disciplines.
